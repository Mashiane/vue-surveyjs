# Vue-SurveyJS

Sample project that shows how to integrate SurveyJS in Vue APP.

This example is based on the example ["Integrate SurveyJS in Ionic"]()https://github.com/abritopach/ionic-surveyjs that I developed but adapted to Vue.js to practice my skills.

NOTE: This project is currently under development until it reaches the same functionality as the ionic project.

Technologies: Vue.js, Vuetify.js, Typescript

This project shows you how to:

    * Integrate SurveyJS in Vue APP.
    * Show list with active surveys using SurveyJS API dxsurvey.com/api (get request).
    * Show list with archive surveys using SurveyJS API dxsurvey.com/api (get request).

## Configuration

 1) To use your own surveys register in [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/Account/Register)
 2) Create your own survey.
 3) In services/survey.service.ts replace: accessKey with your [SurveyJS API accessKey](https://surveyjs.io/Help/Index/).
 
 NOTE: To see your survey [results](https://surveyjs.io/Service/MySurveys/)

## Build Setup

Before you go through this example, you should have at least a basic understanding of Vue concepts. You must also already have Vue Cli installed on your machine.

``` bash
# Install dependencies.
npm install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Vue cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
